# About Me
Hi! I'm Jason and I'm a 3rd year Math-CS student in CSE 110 for Spring 23-24. I'm excited to learn all about what this course has to offer, whether it's from Professor Powell, my classmates, the resources available, or myself! If I were to describe myself with a quote, it would be:

## Fun Facts

## Programming
Most if not all of my programming experience comes down to the courses I've taken from high school and university through now. I've only recently become more passionate and taken the initiative to learn outside of my studies. I still am not sure what direction/specialization I want to move towards, so my main priority is learning what I don't know and what I don't know that I don't know.
